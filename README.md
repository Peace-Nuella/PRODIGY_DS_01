### Distribution Visualization in Google Sheets
#### Overview
This project aims to create a bar chart or histogram in Google Sheets to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable within a dataset. This visualization will help in understanding the data better, allowing for insights into the distribution patterns of attributes such as ages or genders in a population.

#### Objectives
To create a clear and informative visualization that represents the distribution of a selected variable.
To demonstrate the ability to analyze and interpret data distributions using Google Sheets.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project should contain at least one categorical or continuous variable. Examples of suitable datasets include:

#### Interpret the Results
Analyze the resulting chart or histogram to understand the distribution of the variable.
Discuss any patterns or insights observed from the visualization.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of data using bar charts and histograms in Google Sheets. Effective visualization aids in better data analysis and communication of insights derived from the dataset.
